## Welcome

Hello and welcome! Â I am a political scientist who studies non-democratic politics, with a particular focus on electoral manipulation in authoritarian and hybrid regimes. My geographic area of expertise is Russia and the post-communist world. I received my PhD from the University of North Carolina -- Chapel Hill in May 2019; I held a post-doctoral fellowship at the Center for Russia, East Europe, and Central Asia at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, and am currently an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University.

I use multiple tools in my research, including statistical analysis, methods for causal inference (such as regression-discontinuity designs and pre-processing techniques), field interviews, archival study, and survey-experimental research. My work has been published in the [*American Political Science Review*](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055422000090), [*Electoral Studies*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.004), [*Democratization*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2017.1304380), and [*Government and Opposition*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/methods-of-election-manipulation-and-the-likelihood-of-postelection-protest/CD08A891E3804C45D28F31E07828AD00),Â [*Europe-Asia Studies*](https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2019.1681363), and *Russian Politics*.
