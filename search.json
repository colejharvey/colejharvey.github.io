    "section": "",
    "text": "Ruling parties in authoritarian regimes have a broad range of tools with which to influence election outcomes, including ballot-stuffing, falsification, voter-pressure, vote-buying, and more. What limits authoritarian incumbents‚Äô ability to manipulate elections in their favor using these tools? What enables such manipulation?\nThese questions get to the heart of contemporary non-democratic government. The average authoritarian regime today relies on regular, multiparty elections to perpetuate itself in office."
